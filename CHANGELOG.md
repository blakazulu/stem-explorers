## [Unreleased]

### Changed

#### URL Routing - Complete Restructure to Nested Role-Based Routes
- **Breaking:** All dashboard routes now include role prefix (`/admin/...`, `/teacher/...`, `/parent/...`, `/student/...`)
- URLs now preserve state on page refresh (grade, unit, forum room selections)
- Example routes:
  - `/admin/work-plans/א` - Admin viewing grade א work plans
  - `/teacher/forum/requests` - Teacher viewing forum requests room
  - `/student/journal/unit-123` - Student working on specific journal unit

#### New Route Structure
- `[role]/layout.tsx` - Role validation middleware (redirects unauthorized users)
- `[role]/page.tsx` - Role-specific dashboard home
- `[role]/work-plans/page.tsx` - Grade selector
- `[role]/work-plans/[grade]/page.tsx` - Units CRUD for selected grade
- `[role]/pedagogical/page.tsx` - Grade selector (auto-redirects students/parents to their grade)
- `[role]/pedagogical/[grade]/page.tsx` - Unit content tree
- `[role]/documentation/page.tsx` - Grade selector
- `[role]/documentation/[grade]/page.tsx` - Unit selector
- `[role]/documentation/[grade]/[unitId]/page.tsx` - Documentation gallery
- `[role]/reports/page.tsx` - Grade selector (auto-redirects parents to their grade)
- `[role]/reports/[grade]/page.tsx` - Unit selector
- `[role]/reports/[grade]/[unitId]/page.tsx` - AI report viewer
- `[role]/journal/page.tsx` - Unit selector for students
- `[role]/journal/[unitId]/page.tsx` - Research journal wizard
- `[role]/forum/page.tsx` - Redirects to default room
- `[role]/forum/[room]/page.tsx` - Forum posts with room tabs as Links
- `[role]/questions/page.tsx` - Question management (admin only)
- `[role]/passwords/page.tsx` - Password management (admin only)
- `[role]/settings/page.tsx` - Admin settings (buttons, email, reports)

#### Navigation Updates
- Sidebar links now use role-prefixed URLs
- Sidebar active state detection updated for nested routes using `startsWith()`
- GradeSelector now navigates via `router.push()` instead of `setState()`
- Login redirects to `/{role}` based on user role
- Root page (`/`) redirects to `/{role}` or `/login` based on session

### Removed
- Old flat routes (`/dashboard`, `/pedagogical`, `/work-plans`, `/documentation`, `/reports`, `/journal`, `/forum`, `/questions`, `/passwords`, `/admin`)
- State-based grade/unit selection (replaced with URL params)

### Fixed
- AuthContext login return type now includes `role` property for redirect
- GradeSelector prop validation (added required `selected` prop)
